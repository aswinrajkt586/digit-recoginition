Handwritten Digit Classification using Logistic Regression
Project Overview
This project implements a classification model to recognize handwritten digits (0-9) using the load_digits dataset from Scikit-Learn. The dataset consists of 8x8 pixel grayscale images representing each digit. The goal is to develop a logistic regression model, evaluate its performance, and visualize the results, providing insights into the classification process.

Features
Data visualization of sample images from the dataset.
Splitting of the dataset into training and testing sets.
Implementation of a logistic regression model for classification.
Evaluation of model accuracy on the test set.
Visualization of prediction results and confusion matrix.
Dataset
Source: load_digits from Scikit-Learn.
Input: 64 pixel values (features) for each image.
Output: Corresponding digit labels (targets).
Installation
To run this project, ensure you have the following libraries installed:

bash
Copy code
pip install numpy matplotlib scikit-learn seaborn
Usage
Clone the repository:
bash
Copy code
git clone <repository-url>
cd <repository-directory>
Run the digit_classification.py script:
bash
Copy code
python digit_classification.py
Results
The model achieves an accuracy of approximately 96.67% on the test set.
Confusion matrix visualizations highlight model performance and areas for improvement.
Conclusion
This project demonstrates the application of logistic regression for handwritten digit classification. It highlights the importance of data visualization in understanding model performance and potential areas for enhancement.

Future Work
Experiment with more complex models (e.g., SVM, neural networks).
Implement image augmentation techniques to improve accuracy.
